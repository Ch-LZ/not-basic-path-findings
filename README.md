# not-basic-path-findings
Non-basic path finding algorithms implemented in python3. I tried to make it clear and quite efficient.
# Tests
- for A* algorithm in corrsponding path. Answers are in `*.a` files.

# References
Algorithms was implemented during coursera [algorithms-on-graphs cource](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs/home/welcome).
